The website is built with jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com/).
It is hosted at http://blaubot.hgross.eu

To build and view the website locally:
- # install jekyll
- cd website
- jekyll serve
- # open http://localhost:4000/ in the browser

There is a gradle buildfile inside the website module to copy javadocs to the webiste.
This command builds and copies the javadoc of all middleware modules to the "javadoc" dir of the website.
- ./gradlew --daemon copyDocsToWebsite

Deploy the site to the production system:
- cd website
- jekyll build
- cd ..
- ./gradlew --daemon uploadWebsite
